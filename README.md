# Assignment: Examine Data Breaches
When analyzing data related to information leaks, both the method of presentation and the medium used greately influence how we interpret and understand the information. In this activity, I explored the visual representation of leak data, particularly focusing on the "Method of Leak" displayed through bubbles, and compared it to the previous textual data presentation.

Common Types of Leaks
Upon clicking "Method of Leak," it became evident that the most common types of leaks are those due to hacking and poor security. This visualization clearly shows the prevalence of these two methods, highlighting their dominance over other types of leaks. 

Why Are These Leaks Common?
The prevalence of hacking and poor security as primary methods of leaks can be attributed to several factors:

Hacking: With the rise of sophisticated cyber-attacks and the continuous evolution of hacking techniques, itâ€™s not surprising that hacking is the most common method of data breach. Attackers are constantly finding new vulnerabilities to exploit, making it a persistent threat.
Poor Security: On the other hand, poor security practices often come from human error, lack of awareness, or insufficient resources allocated to security measures. Organizations that fail to implement strong security protocols or that neglect regular updates and patches are particularly vulnerable to breaches.

Visual vs. Textual Data Presentation
The visual representation of data via the bubble chart provides a different perspective compared to the previous textual data presentation. While textual data can be detailed and informative, it often feels plain and wordy, which might overwhelm or disengage the reader. The visual format, however, conveys the same information in an interesting manner, allowing for quicker understanding and easier identification of patterns.

The bubbles not only make the data more engaging but also enable a deeper understanding of the frequency and impact of different types of leaks. By instantly showing which methods are most common, the visual format increases our ability to understand the data's story at a glance, something that the textual format might struggle to achieve.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the visual representation of data in this activity is more effective at conveying the story behind the numbers than the previous textual presentation. It offers a clearer, more engaging way to understand the prevalence and significance of different leak methods.
